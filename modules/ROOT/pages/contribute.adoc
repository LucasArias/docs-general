Many of our documentation repositories are open and we welcome your contributions!

To contribute to the English version of this documentation:

. Select *Edit in Github* on the page you want to modify.
. Submit a pull request to the Git repository.
. If this is the first time you are submitting a pull request,
run the https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/notebooks/#d28e8f95e739ee1e1e30d5ec577f4a27[API Notebook].
If you aren't already logged in to your GitHub account, you can do so using a link provided in the API Notebook.

A Salesforce bot asks you in your pull request to complete this process if you submit the pull request without running the API Notebook first.
Normally you'll only have to run the API Notebook once per GitHub account.

The Documentation team will either accept your PR or reach out if there are questions.
