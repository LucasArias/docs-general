[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Feature: Description| RAML Implementation | OAS Implementation | API Designer Support 
+4| Modularity: The ability to break an API specification into reusable and shared units.
| API Document: The main API specification description metadata, which is the entry point for the specification. | RAML root document | OAS root document | The design of the API project console is rendered and the document and examples are validated. 
| Libraries: The unit containing collections of related reusable description elements. | RAML library | Can be implemented using an empty OAS specification containing multiple components. | Edited as a stand-alone project. Supports the reuse of the module in an API project.
| Fragments: Stand-alone component of the specification that describes a specific element. | RAML fragment | Can be implemented using an empty OAS specification containing a single component.| Edited as a stand-alone project. Supports the reuse of the module in an API project. 
| Overlays: A partial description of the API specification that you can use to overwrite non-functional aspects of the API specification by composing it with the original specification, for example, translating the documentation to other languages. | RAML overlay | Can be simulated with JSON patch or merge preprocessing. | Can be edited and rendered correctly if used as main the project file.
| Extensions: A partial description of the API spec that can be used to overwrite non-functional aspects of the API spec composing it with the original specification, like for example adding the security information for a managed API | RAML extension | Can be simulated with JSON patch or merge preprocessing. | Can be edited and rendered correctly if used as main the project file.
+4| Reusability: The ability to reuse of the API description in multiple specifications.
| Inline declarations and references: The ability to declare and reference elements from multiple documents. | Inclusion and named references to: datatypes, traits, resource types, and annotations declarations. | JSON reference and OAS components. | Autocompletion when editing and dedicated rendering provided in the console.
| Traits: Macros that extend operations in the functional model, such as pagination, that can be reused in multiple specifications for consistency | Operation macros and RAML traits | Not applicable | Autocompletion when editing and dedicated rendering in console.
| Resource types: Macros that extend resources in the functional model with complex behavior and data definition that can be reused in multiple specifications for consistency | Endpoint macros and RAML resource types | Not applicable | Autocompletion when editing and dedicated rendering in console.
+4| API Metadata: Part of the specification for humans//Jonathan--what does this mean? 
| API Entrypoint: The main entry point for the API description, mostly human-readable information, such as title, version, license, and so forth. | RAML document top level information | OAS Open API object| Can be edited and validated and enables console rendering.
| Server and protocols: Denotes the actual connectivity to the service | RAML base URI information | OAS Server object | Small differences in the supported protocols.
| Terms of service & licensing: The user agreement and licensing information of the API | Only plain documentation | OAS Info object | 
| User documentation: ? | RAML description properties in different parts of the specification | OAS description properties in the specification objects | Can be edited and validated and enables console rendering.
| Localized documentation: Specifies multi-lingual descriptions | Using overlays | Not applicable | Not applicable 
| Tags: Classification of parts of the specification | Only use annotations | OAS Tag object | Not applicable
+4| Functional model: definition--what does this mean?
| Endpoints: Refers to the resources and RPC invocations in the API | RAML resources--RAML is more RESTful, which makes it explicit in its working with resources and allowing the nesting of those resources | OAS Path Item objects under the Paths object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Methods and bindings to HTTP uniform interface: Includes operations over the resource and information about how to invoke the RPC operation. | Get, Patch, Put, Post, Delete, Options, and head RAML operations | Get, Put, Post, Delete, Options, Head, Patch, Trace and fixed fields under the OAS Path Item object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Input parameters and HTTP bindings: Specifies the input parameters for the operation. | RAML parameters | OAS Parameter object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Responses with multiple media types: Specifies the output parameter for the operation. | RAML responses | OAS Response object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Responses with bindings to HTTP status codes: Specifies the binding to the HTTP status code. | RAML responses | OAS Response object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Callbacks: Specifies the asynchronous invocations and webhooks. | Not applicable | OAS Callback object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Links: Specifies the static connections between endpoints in the specification, excluding hyperlinks in the data. |  Not applicable | OAS Link object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
+4| Security model: definition--what does this mean?
| OAuth 1.0: ? | RAML security schemes | Not applicable |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
| OAuth 2.0: ? | RAML security schemes | OAS Security Scheme object |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
| Basic: ? | RAML security schemes | OAS Security Scheme object |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
| Digest: ? | RAML security schemes | Not applicable |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
| API Key: ? | Not applicable | OAS Security Scheme object |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
| Open ID Connect: ? | Not applicable | OAS Security Scheme object |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
| Pass through: ? | RAML security schemes | Not applicable |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
| Custom: ? | RAML security schemes | OAS Security Scheme object |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering. Note that the security schemes might be out-of-sync with actual policy in API Manager.
+4| Data description and validation: definition--what does this mean?
| JSON schema constraints and support: ? This is the base for both. RAML Types is a superset | RAML JSON support | OAS Schema object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Schema Inheritance: ? RAML types specific | RAML type inheritance | *Simulated with `$allOf`, not proper inheritance, murky situation in OAS Schema??* | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Type expressions: ? RAML types specific| RAML type expressions | Not applicable |  Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| XML Schema constraints and support: ? | RAML XML support provided indirectly through RAML 'xml' facets for RAML types. | Support provided indirectly through XML properties for the `Schema object` | Limited editing support provided.
| Examples: ? | RAML examples | OAS `Example object` | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
| Mandatory valid examples: ? | Not applicable | Not applicable | Allows validation
+4| Meta-model extensibility: Defines the ability to extend the format to describe additional details or objects.
| Custom property extensions: ? | Annotations | OAS specification extensions | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering.
