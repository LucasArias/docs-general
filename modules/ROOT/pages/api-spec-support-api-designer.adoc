| Feature | Description | RAML Implementation | OAS Implementation | API Designer Support 
| Modularity | The ability to break an API specification into reusable and shared units. | Not applicable  | Not applicable  | Not applicable 
| API Document | The main API specification description metadata, which is the entry point for the specification. | RAML doc | OAS doc | The design of the API project console is rendered and the document and examples are validated. |
| Libraries | The unit containing collections of related reusable description elements. | RAML library | Implemented indirectly using an empty specification. Only components are supported in the OAS doc. | Edited as a stand-alone project. Supports the reuse of the module in an API project.
| Fragments | Stand-alone component of the specification that describes a specific element. | RAML fragment | Implemented indirectly using an empty specification with only one declaration
or an OAS doc with a single component.| Edited as a stand-alone project and reuse of the module enabled in an API project. |
| Overlays | A partial description of the API specification that you can use to overwrite non-functional aspects of the API specification by composing it with the original specification, for example, translating the documentation to other languages. | RAML overlay | Can be simulated with JSON patch or merge tooling. | Can be edited and rendered correctly if used as main the project file.|
| Extensions | Partial description of the API spec that can be used to overwrite non-functional aspects of the API spec composing it with the original specification, like for example adding the security information for a managed API | RAML extension | Can be simulated with JSON patch or merge tooling. | Can be edited and rendered correctly if used as main the project file.
| Reusability | Ability to reuse of the API description in multiple specifications. | Not applicable | Not applicable  | Not applicable 
| Inline declarations and references | Ability to declare and reference elements from multiple documents. | Inclusion and name refs, RAML type, traits, resource types, and annotations declarations. | JSON-Refs and OAS components. | Autocompletion when editing and dedicated rendering provided in the console.
| Traits | Macros that extend operations in the functional model, such as pagination, that can be reused in multiple specifications for consistency | Operation macros and RAML traits | Not applicable | Autocompletion when editing and dedicated rendering in console.
| Resource types | Macros that extend resources in the functional model with complex behavior and data definition that can be reused in multiple specifications for consistency | Endpoint macros
and RAML resource types | Not applicable | Autocompletion when editing and dedicated rendering in console.
| API Metadata | *Do we need this?*| | |
| API Entrypoint | The main entry point for the API description, mostly human-readable information, such as title, version, license, and so forth. | RAML document top level information | OAS Open API object| Can be edited and validated and enables console rendering.
| Server and protocols | Actual connectivity to the service | RAML base URI information | OAS Server object | Small differences in the supported protocols 
| Terms of service & licensing | User agreement and licensing information of the API | Only plain documentation | OAS Info object | 
| User documentation | ? | RAML description properties in different parts of the spec | OAS different 'description' properties in the spec 'objects' 
| Localized documentation | Multi-lingual descriptions | Through overlays | Not applicable | Not applicable 
| Tags | Classification of parts of the specification | Only use annotations | OAS Tag object | Not applicable
| Endpoints | Resources and RPC invocations in the API | RAML resources | OAS Path Item objects under the Paths object | RAML is more RESTful, which makes it explicit in its working with resources and allowing the nesting of those resources | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering
| Methods and bindings to HTTP uniform interface | Operations over the resource and information about how to invoke the RPC operation | Get, Patch, Put, Post, Delete, Options, and head RAML operations | Get, Put, Post, Delete, Options, Head, Patch, Trace and fixed fields under the OAS Path Item object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering
| Input parameters and HTTP bindings | Input parameters and HTTP bindings | RAML parameters | OAS Parameter object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering
| Responses with multiple media types | Output parameter for the operation | RAML responses | OAS Response object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering
| Responses with bindings to HTTP status codes | Binding to the HTTP status code | RAML responses | OAS Response object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering
| Callbacks | Asynchronous invocations and webhooks | Not applicable | OAS Callback object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering
| Links | Static connections between endpoints in the specification, excluding hyperlinks in the data |  Not applicable | OAS Link object | Allows editing and validations, and enables console rendering
